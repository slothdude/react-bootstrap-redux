                            I started this job when I was a sophomore in high school. My Chemistry teacher loved me
                            and I did well in the class so he offered me a job to work for his bio-tech lab company
                            as a sales representative. I ended up maintaining the website (adding/changing products) well
                            into college, but later taught him how to do it himself (and left) to save the company some money.

                            This was a really easy job where I sat in a booth and recorded lectures for graduate school
                            engineering classes (thanks for the referral Hannah!). The recordings would go online but
                            students would also stream the class, and could ask questions via speakers and TVs around the
                            room to make it like they were really in the classroom. I left because I had hard classes senior year
                            and needed to focus on them (CMSC430 omg)

                            I tought two young sisters(7th and 10th grade) math in my spare time (thanks for the refferal Tommy!)
                            It's mainly just algebra, trig, and word problems. The family is super sweet, and it's a really nice
                            side job to have. Sometimes I do it over facetime so it's pretty easy. They are doing well in school
                            and the younger one is the coding champ of the school!

                            It has always been a dream of mine to work at NASA. I don't program anything that goes into space, just
                            web-apps to help the financial people on the ground stay organized. Graduating college is a really scary time when you don't
                             have a job and never really had an internship. I focused on making personal projects while living at my parent's house to land this one.
                             Recruiters called me after putting up my resume on <a href="dice.com">dice.com</a>.
                             <hr/>
                             While there, I learned SQL, more node.js and react, accessibility practices for users with disabilities, and probably too much about <a href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable">handsontable.</a>
                              The crown jewel of my work here is the Plan vs Actuals module of an app called BETS PvA (primarily used by <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis">ESDIS</a>) that basically replaces google sheets in the browser, allowing collaborarion
                              (not in real time, lockouts were implemented if a user was editing). Custom formulas with immediate propagation, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/exceljs">excel downloading</a>, user roles and permissions with <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWTs</a> made it come together.
                              I helped build this with the coding legend Matt Henderson ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤ ðŸš€ who also set up a really cool dev deployment setup where each git branch in the project gets deployed to its own url.
                              <hr/>
                              Main takeaway: Atlassian sucks (jk but seriously: support, docs, and forum game <em>weak</em>. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> for the win)
